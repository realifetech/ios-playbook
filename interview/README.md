# Interview Process
Interviewing for technical positions can suck. When interviews aren't good for the candidate, they often result in a bad hire for the company. We want to avoid that.  

To make you feel as comfortable as possible, we would like to give you as much knowledge ahead of time about the process you will go through when applying for a role with us.  

The main goal of our interview process is for us to work out if we are a good fit for one another. This includes technically (can you do the job you are applying for?), culturally (will you fit in with the culture of the company?), and personally (do we want to spend time in each other's company?)  

Typically, our interview process consists of three stages:
1. 15-30 minute phone interview
2. [Technical task](task)
3. ~2 hour face-to-face interview  

If you are successful in a stage, we will invite you to complete the next stage. If not, we will try to give you as much feedback as possible, so that your time has been spent constructively.

## Phone interview
One of our developers will give you a quick call to find out a little bit about you, and tell you a little bit about us.
We'll likely ask about your current work situation, experience, availability, and some basic technical questions. We're trying to find out if it will be beneficial for both of us to progress to the next stage of the application.

## Technical task
We'll send you a [technical task](task) to complete in your own time. We realise that your time is precious, so we aren't going to ask anything outrageous of you. We want to get an idea of how you work and your practical technical skills.

## F2F interview
We'll invite you to our office for a face-to-face interview with some members of our team. This will be typically split in two parts.
Firstly, we'll hold a technical based session, where we ask you questions and work through the test you submitted. We'll likely ask you to augment the test in some way, and work through it with you.
Lastly, we'll hold a soft-skill and culture based session, where we give a chance non-developer employees to get to know you, and make sure you will fit culturally.

## Next steps
If your application is successful, we may send you an offer of employment and template contract to look through.
If we're all happy, we'll get the paperwork signed and eagerly await your first day!
